Git and GitHub are essential tools for developers and teams working on software projects. In this article, we’ll define some common Git and GitHub terms and commands with code examples to help you understand how they work and how they can be used to collaborate on code.

> ***THIS ARTICLE WILL HAVE TWO SECTIONS:***
>
> ***SECTION 1: WILL DISCUSS CRUCIAL TERMS IN THE WORLD OF GIT AND GITHUB.***
>
> ***SECTION 2:WILL DISCUSS DEEPLY SEVERAL GIT COMMANDS AND THEIR CODE EXAMPLES***

# **SECTION ONE:**

# **GIT AND GITHUB TERMINOLOGIES**

# Repository (repo)

A repository, or repo for short, is a collection of files and folders that are tracked and managed by Git. A repo contains all the files and history of the project, including any branches and commits. Each repo has a unique URL that can be used to clone it to your local machine.

# Commit

A commit is a saved change to a repository. Each commit has a unique ID and contains a message describing the change. When you make changes to the files in your repo and then commit those changes, the commit creates a new point in the project’s history. Commits are often made to a specific branch.

# Branch

A branch is a parallel version of a repository that allows multiple contributors to make changes to the codebase at the same time. By default, every repo has a `master` branch, which is considered the main branch. Developers can create new branches for bug fixes, new features, or experimentation. Once changes are made in a branch, they can be merged into the `master` branch.

# Merge

The process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is where you have different version of the code, and then you decide to integrate those changes into your main branch or master branch. After that, you can decide to delete the branch that you merged, or keep it for historical reasons or for any future reference

# Pull request

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. Pull requests are used to review and discuss code changes before they are merged. They are a way to get feedback from other developers, and also is a way to track changes and bug or features that you are implementing.

# Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository that you can control and modify. You can then submit changes to the original repository using a pull request. This is often used when the repository owner does not have write access to the original repo, and wants to propose changes to the code.

# SECTION TWO:

# GIT AND GITHUB COMMANDS AND CODE EXAMPLES

Under this section, we will delve deeper into the world of Git and examine some of the key terms and commands that are essential for effectively utilizing this powerful tool. Not only will we provide definitions for these terms, but we will also include practical code examples to demonstrate their usage. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, this article will help you gain a better understanding of how to utilize Git to its fullest potential.

Git is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from version control and collaboration to code management and deployment. However, it can be overwhelming for beginners to get started with all the different terms and commands that are used in Git. In this section, we’ll take a look at 15 common Git terms, their meanings, and code examples to help you understand and use Git more effectively.

1. **Clone**: A clone is a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. The command `git clone [url]` is used to create a clone. For example, `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git` will create a clone of the repository at the specified URL.
2. **Commit**: A commit is a saved version of your code. The command `git commit -m "message"` is used to commit changes to a local repository. For example, `git commit -m "Added new feature"` will save changes to the repository with a message describing the changes.
3. **Push**: A push is the act of sending commits to a remote repository. The command `git push [remote] [branch]` is used to push commits. For example, `git push origin master` will send commits on the master branch to the remote named 'origin'.
4. **Pull**: A pull is the act of fetching and merging changes from a remote repository to a local repository. The command `git pull [remote] [branch]` is used to pull changes. For example, `git pull origin master` will fetch and merge changes on the master branch from the remote named 'origin'.
5. **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. The command `git branch [branch-name]` is used to create a new branch. For example, `git branch feature-x` will create a new branch named 'feature-x'.
6. **Checkout**: The command `git checkout [branch-name]` is used to switch between branches. For example, `git checkout feature-x` will switch to the 'feature-x' branch.
7. **Merge**: A merge is the act of integrating changes from one branch into another. The command `git merge [branch-name]` is used to merge changes. For example, `git merge feature-x` will integrate changes from the 'feature-x' branch into the current branch.
8. **Fetch**: Fetch is the act of downloading the latest commits from a remote repository without merging them. The command `git fetch [remote]` is used to fetch the commits. For example, `git fetch origin` will download the latest commits from the 'origin' remote.
9. **Stash**: Stash is a way of temporarily saving changes that you have made to your working directory but do not want to commit yet. The command `git stash` will stash changes. And `git stash apply` will bring the changes back.
10. **Tag**: A tag is a label that can be applied to a specific commit in a repository. The command `git tag [tag-name]` is used to create a new tag. For example, `git tag v1.0` will create a new tag named 'v1.0' at the current commit.
11. **Reset**: The command `git reset` is used to undo commits and other changes. For example, `git reset --hard HEAD~1` will undo the last commit and discard any changes in the working directory. `git reset [commit-id]` will reset the repository to a specific commit.
12. **Rebase**: The command `git rebase` is used to reapply commits on top of another branch. For example, `git rebase master` will reapply the commits from the current branch on top of the master branch.
13. **Diff**: The command `git diff` is used to show the difference between the current state of the repository and the last committed state. For example, `git diff` will show the differences in the working directory, while `git diff HEAD` will show the differences between the working directory and the last commit.
14. **Log**: The command `git log` is used to view the commit history of a repository. For example, `git log` will show the commit history, while `git log -p` will show the commit history with the changes made in each commit.
15. **Config**: The command `git config` is used to set configuration values for a repository. For example, `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` will set the name for the global Git configuration, while `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"` will set the email for the global Git configuration.
